## My brief story

10 years ago I created my first website, then I got into Vladivostok State University of Physics and Computer Science. 8 years ago I launched my 100th website, 5 years ago I created the first service on the “uber” business model (uber for rewriting). 2 years ago I have invested 10000$ to bitcoins and return ~100 000$ profit.

A year ago, I found out that earnings (and on the Internet and in real life and in the factory and in business) in my country depends on oil prices. Not based on how well you know maths, not on negotiation or business skills, not on looks. In world economics I’m simply oil barrel, nothing more. Disappointing to realize this when you 25 :(

My firend tall me about themeforest.net . I decided to look into it. Checked financials. I thought it’s a sign, if I do web development for 10 years and I have some spare cash, it’s a good time to invest in this business. This is totally in my field(website creation, php, html, css) and international.
