Martian Coder is an open-source `MDX` blog that allows developers to share their knowledge and insights with the community. It combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components, making it an ideal platform for writing rich, interactive blog posts. If you want to contribute a blog post, the process is simple and straightforward. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the necessary steps to write and submit a post to Martian Coder.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

The first step to contributing to Martian Coder is forking the repository. By forking, you create a personal copy of the original Martian Coder repository, which allows you to freely make changes without affecting the main repository. 

Here’s how you do it:
- Go to the [Martian Coder GitHub repository](https://github.com/MuhammadKaifNazeer/martian-coder/).
- Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of the page.
- This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository to Your Local Machine

Now that you’ve forked the repository, it’s time to clone it to your local machine so you can start working on it.

- Open a terminal on your computer and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository.
- Run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/martian-coder.git
```
- This command will create a local copy of the repository on your machine, allowing you to make changes locally.

## Step 3: Create a New `.mdx` File in the Content Folder

Once you have the repository cloned to your local machine, the next step is to create a new .mdx file for your blog post. This file will contain the content of your blog post in `MDX` format, which allows you to mix markdown and React components.

- Navigate to the `content` folder.
- Inside this folder, create a new `.mdx` file with a descriptive name for your post, such as `how-to-write-a-post-on-martian-coder.mdx`.

## Step 4: Write Your Post in MDX Format

Now that you’ve created the `.mdx` file, it’s time to write the content of your post. Open the file in your preferred text editor, and start writing your post. Here's an example of how your post might look in MDX format:

Ensure that your post has proper headings, markdown for formatting, and includes relevant code snippets or images if necessary. 

## Step 5: Make a Pull Request

Once you’ve written your post, it’s time to submit it to the main Martian Coder repository. The way you do this is by creating a pull request.

1. First, stage and commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
```
```bash
git commit -m "Add new blog post on how to contribute to Martian Coder"

2. Push your changes to your remote fork:
